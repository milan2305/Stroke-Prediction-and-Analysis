    According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11 percent of total deaths. Stroke is becoming an important cause of premature death and disability in low-income and middle-income countries like India, largely driven by demographic changes and enhanced by the increasing prevalence of the key modifiable risk factors.The project deals with a US based stroke data set in order to find a pattern in the data and predetermine the possibility of stroke in a person.
